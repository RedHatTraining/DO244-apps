##hello-event-quarkus Project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

##Creating a Serverless Cloud EventsFunction

For Quarkus, kn func create -l quarkus -t http function-name

##Building a Serverless Function
                            kn func build

##Quarkus Dev Mode
In a termainal, chnage drectory to come at the project-directory & execute

                          ./mvnw quarkus:dev

And once the app is successfully up, the banner of QUARKUS appears on the terminal.

##For testing the Quarkus Application

For testing the Quarkus functions locally on your computer by running the Maven tests that are included in the project template.

We open a new terminal in the project directory and run

                           ./mvnw test

And second way is to test the application using unit testing.

##Local Execution Using Curl Command

We can also test the application after it is successfully deployed using curl command:
- For this we need a spoof template for a cloud event that we can send via curl.

curl "http://localhost:8080/" -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "Ce-SpecVersion: 1.0" \
-H "Ce-Type: dev.knative.example" \
-H "Ce-Source: hello-event-quarkus" \
-H "Ce-Id: 1" \
-d '{"message": "Hello there."}'

## Local Execution Using func emit

        kn func emit -k local -d "First Program"

Here,
      -k is for local
      -d is for sending the messages

Once the application is up, on the terminal we have to press r to resume testing for the unit test classes mentioned.

##Deploying the Serverless Function

                              kn func deploy -v
