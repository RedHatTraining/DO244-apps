                  kn func create -l quarkus -t http function-name
                  

## Building a Serverless Function

                                kn func build

In a termainal, chnage drectory to come at the project-directory & execute

                              ./mvnw quarkus:dev

## For testing the Quarkus Application

For testing the Quarkus functions locally on your computer by running the Maven tests that are included in the project template.

- We open a new terminal in the project directory and run

                                 ./mvnw test
                                 
And second way is to test the application using unit testing

  - Once the application is up, on the terminal we have to press r to resume testing for the unit test classes mentioned.

## Deploying the Serverless Function

                                 kn func deploy -v
